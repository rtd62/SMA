### Social Media Analytics (Facebook Page Insights)

Web application that pulls Insights from a Facebook Page and displays them. [update in progress]

I forked this from another user.
In theory, this is an application which logs you in to Facebook, grabs a list of the Pages you manage, and then display certain Insights based off of set metrics.

Hello [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) contributors! I have here a web application that needs some work, and I wanted some help! This will be a great opportunity for you guys to receive the shirt and stickers for this event!

### Allow me to explain a little about the app:

Last year, I was working on a web application project that needed to use the Facebook Graph API to grab Insights from a user's Page that they manage. Particularly, in this case, the Page's follower count. I wanted to be able to pull the Insights, display the data from the API, and be able to save that to a database, and eventually display it in a nice graph.

After tons of searching through repos here on GitHub, I was able to fork an old project from three years ago called [SMA](https://github.com/Tudor-B/SMA). I wanted to be able to build on this so that developers in the future could benefit as well.

### I have a list of things that I would like to be able to fix/implement, all outlined here at --> [#1](https://github.com/rtd62/facebook-insights/issues/1)
